I am a mobile and web developer with over 10 years of experience. Currently, I'm specializing in mobile development
(both native and cross-platform), but I was working as a frontend and backend developer as well, so I know the
development process from each side.

I'm working as a Head of Mobile Development at [Mews](https://github.com/mewsSystems/developers), so creating the
architecture, code reviewing, mentoring, and integrating best practices is a part of my everyday job.

Currently, I'm mainly interested in Flutter. We have an application written in Flutter that is successfully running in
production for more than a year.

If you need help with defining the right architecture for your mobile app (both from back-end and front-end sides) or
looking for a mentor / code reviewer, feel free to contact me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ookamikb/)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ookami_kb) (or book me at [Mentoring Club](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/kirill-bubochkin)) and let’s have a talk.
